This project strives to have minimal environmental requirements.
Currently you only need Maven installed (or integrated into your IDE),
and the JDK installed of course.

On Windows, if using the appassembler bat script invoke the project,
currently you have to create an environment
variable CLASSPATH_PREFIX set to the location of your jdk tools jar;
something like:  
	"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_14\lib\tools.jar" 
	(notice the quotes--you need the quotes due to behavior of appassembler script).

On Mac OS, this is not necessary because tools.jar does not exist in the
JDK as a separate jar.

Linux untested.
